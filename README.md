This is a 'Tech Demo' meaning that this project is currently at a _very_ early stage of development. More showing capabilities of what is possible.  
  
Currently Demonstrating:

- Windowing UI within the browser

- Open/view random 3D models packaged in GLTF (.glb) format

- Open text and edit in an editor window (With VIM keybindings)

- Parse dialog script text.

- Display dialog that is running the given script.

- Change the script and automatically update the dialog scene.  
  
Usage:

#1 Click 'Open Story'

#2 Allow browser access to folder containing your story

Have fun :)

- Click on .glb files to open 3D model

- Click on .txt files to open text editor window and then hit 'Play Dialog' to open sample dialog window (NOTE: VIM keybindings only presently)  
- Edit text and see changes to the scene.
